# Employee Records

You are to create a collection of employee's information for your company. Each employee has the following attributes:

* Name
* Job title
* Salary
* Status

First, you will create an array named `employees`

Next, you will create an `Employee` constructor with the first three attributes defined at the time of instantiation and the fourth will be defaulted to "Full Time".

This constructor will also have a method called `printEmployeeForm` that prints the employee's information to the console.

(e.g. "Name: Bob, Job Title: V School Instructor, Salary: $3000/hour, Status: Part time")

You will then:

* Instantiate three employees
* Override the status attribute of one of them to either "Part Time" or "Contract"
* Call the printEmployeeForm method for each employee
* Put the generated employees into the employees array using whichever method you prefer.
