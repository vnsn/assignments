# Escape Room

Write a game that lets a user escape a room. The character finds him/herself locked in a room. In order to escape the room, your character needs to find the key in the room and then open the door. There's also a hole in the wall in the room. If your character puts his hand in the hole, he dies.

## Game start:
Tell the user their options:

1. Put hand in hole
2. Find the key, or
3. Open the door

They can't open the door unless they find the key first. 
They die if they put their hand in the hole.
