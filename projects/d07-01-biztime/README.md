#  Business Time
You just decided to start a business. You know you need a website, but you're bootstrapping your business without external funding, so you can't pay someone else to do it.

The type of business doesn't really matter, so get creative with it. This will be a static website, so it doesn't require the use of any JavaScript. However, if you want to go above-and-beyond, you're welcome to include some JavaScript too.

Your site should be well-styled and should look good on mobile screens (that is, it should be responsive).

##  Project Requirements
Create a website for your new business that is well-styled, responsive, and includes at least the following items:

* Inline/Block elements
* Divs & spans
* Images
* List (navigation bar can count as a "list")
* Headers/paragraphs
* Semantic HTML (HTML 5 new tags)
* CSS Box model (margin, padding, border, width/height
* Responsive (Media queries, Flexbox, Bootstrap Grid, CSS Grids, or any combination of the above)
* Multiple HTML pages, linked
   
##  Passing Criteria: Class Demo
